In this project I created a dashboard using coffee sales data. I was able to work on using Xlookups to populate certain fields. I also used pivot tables to easily create charts out of the data. 
There are slicers applied to allow the user to filter the data as well as a timeline so users can navigate through data across different periods seamlessly.
