In this project I created a dashboard using coffee sales data. I was able to work on using Xlookups to populate certain fields. I also used pivot tables to easily create charts out of the data. 
There are slicers applied to allow the user to filter the data. This project helped improve my ability to display meaningful data in an appealing and informative manner.
