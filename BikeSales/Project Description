In this project I obtained a bike sales dataset from Kaggle. After cleaning the data by reformatting some columns and removing duplicates, I created pivot tables and used these to create charts. I used these charts to then create a dashboard.
The charts have slicers to allow viewers to filter the charts to view desired information.
